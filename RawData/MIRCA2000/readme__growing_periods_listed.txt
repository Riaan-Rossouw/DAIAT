*********************************************************************************************************
Global data set of Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA2000), version 1.1
*********************************************************************************************************

------ CONTENTS

The files in this folder represent monthly cropping periods (growing periods) of irrigated and rainfed crops
and sub-crops including the related growing areas (Cropping Periods List, CPL) 
in 5 arc-minute and 30 arc-minute grid cell resolution (data unit: hectare).

The files were generated by the Global Crop Water Model (GCWM),
using Monthly Growing Area Grids of irrigated and rainfed crops (MGAG) and related condensed crop calendars (CCC)
of the MIRCA2000 data set. 
The data set and the GCWM model are documented at:
http://www2.uni-frankfurt.de/45217988/GCWM,
and
http://www2.uni-frankfurt.de/45218023/MIRCA.

This is version 1.1 of the data set. The difference to version 1.0 is the implementation of a bugfix to
ensure consistency of two major input data sets indicating cropland extent (Ramankutty et al., 2008) 
and harvested crop areas (Monfreda et al., 2008).


------ DATA FORMAT

The 2 files (one per resolution) are compressed versions (gnu-zip format) of tab-separated plain text files
and have the current file names:
(1) 5 arc-minute grid:	CELL_SPECIFIC_CROPPING_CALENDARS.TXT(.gz)
(2) 30 arc-minute grid:	CELL_SPECIFIC_CROPPING_CALENDARS_30MN.TXT(.gz).

They list growing periods of irrigated and rainfed crops and their sub-crops including the related growing areas 
(in hectares) for each 5 arc-minute and 30 arc-minute grid cell with harvested area. Grid cells and crops 
without areas are not listed.

The files have a header of one row. The meaning of the columns is as follows:
1.) cell_ID = cell-ID (counting from NW to SE beginning with 1 => in 5-minute resolution 4320 X 2160 cells)
2.) row = number of row (counting from N to S beginning with 1 => in 5-minute resolution 2160 rows)
3.) column = number of column (counting from W to E beginning with 1 => in 5-minute resolution 4320 columns)
4.) lat = latitude of cell center (in decimal degrees)
5.) lon = longitude of cell center (in decimal degrees)
6.) crop = crop class (1-26, see below)
7.) subcrop = sub-crop number (in 5 arc-minute resolution up to 5, in 30 arc-minute resolution up to 9 sub-crops per cell)
8.) area = sub-crop growing area (in hectares)
9.) start = start of cropping period (month of the year, number between 1 (January) and 12 (December))
10.) end = end of cropping period (month of the year, number between 1 (January) and 12 (December)).

The growing area (harvested area per cropping period) is given in hectare (ha).

The codes for the 26 crop classes are as follows, irrigated crops (IRC) are numbered from 1-26, 
and rainfed crops (RFC) obtain a number increased by 26 with respect to the analog irrigated crop, 
ranging from 27 to 52:
IRC	RFC	CropClass
1	27	Wheat
2	28	Maize
3	29	Rice
4	30	Barley
5	31	Rye
6	32	Millet
7	33	Sorghum
8	34	Soybeans
9	35	Sunflower
10	36	Potatoes
11	37	Cassava
12	38	Sugar cane
13	39	Sugar beet
14	40	Oil palm
15	41	Rapeseed / Canola
16	42	Groundnuts / Peanuts
17	43	Pulses
18	44	Citrus
19	45	Date palm
20	46	Grapes / Vine
21	47	Cotton
22	48	Cocoa
23	49	Coffee
24	50	Others perennial
25	51	Fodder grasses
26	52	Others annual.
